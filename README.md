# Barcode Scanner

Hello!

## Barcode Scanner and Eclipse

Here follows the instructions for importing and running the project in the Eclipse IDE:

## Requirements

  - Eclipse IDE: http://www.eclipse.org/
  - Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
  - Android Development Tools: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html

## Instructions

After setting up the requirements and setting up a virtual mobile device in eclipse, running Android version 4.1+, you can follow these instructions:

1. In eclipse: File -> Import -> Existing Android Code Into Project Into Workspace; note that you could also import the project as a Git project.
2. Click on "Browse" and navigate to the root of the git project. There you choose the "Barcodescanner" sub-folder.


This screen is for the first time the user starts the app. It asks them whether or not they are a customer or a shop owner and display some sort of welcome message / information.

This screen is display when the user starts the app after he has selected his user-status. It provides easy access to scanning and the database, and the third button which I've not decided upon.
